    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (behavior)\n",
    "                 together within a class. It promotes data hiding by keeping the internal state of \n",
    "                 an object hidden from the outside and only allowing access to it through well-defined \n",
    "                 methods. Encapsulation helps in achieving abstraction, security, and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes (child or derived classes) based on \n",
    "               existing classes (parent or base classes). The derived classes inherit the attributes \n",
    "               and methods of the base class, which promotes code reuse and the creation of hierarchical \n",
    "               relationships among classes. Inheritance enables the implementation of the \"is-a\" relationship, \n",
    "               where a derived class is a specialized version of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same \n",
    "                message or method call. It allows different classes to have different implementations of a \n",
    "                method with the same name. Polymorphism enables flexibility and extensibility in the code, as \n",
    "                it allows objects to take multiple forms and exhibit different behaviors based on the context \n",
    "                in which they are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on providing a simplified and generalized view of objects or systems. It \n",
    "               involves hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features and behaviors. \n",
    "               Abstraction allows the creation of abstract classes or interfaces that define contracts for \n",
    "               classes to implement. It enables the separation of interface and implementation, promoting modular \n",

    "\n",
    "1.Accessing Object Attributes and Methods: By using self, you can access the attributes and methods of the \n",
    "                                           object within the class. It allows you to refer to the specific \n",

    "                     class on which the method is called. It allows the method to operate on the specific object's\n",

    "\n",
    "3.Object Construction: During the construction of an object, the self parameter is used to represent the newly \n",
    "                       created instance of the class. It allows you to initialize the object's attributes and set\n",
    "                       up its initial state within the __init__() method.\n",

    "                             It allows one object to invoke methods or access attributes of another object within the \n",

    "\n",
    "By convention, the name self is used, but it is not a reserved keyword in Python. You can choose a different name for \n",
    "the first parameter of a method, but using self makes the code more readable and consistent with common practices.\n",
